#Quote Machine

**Front End Web Practice Project:** The goal of this project is to use pure javascript and HTML/CSS to display random quotes. If the user likes the quote they can use a button to retweet the quote on twitter.

This project is completed without any frameworks. Twitters web intents api is used to post tweets to the users timeline.
